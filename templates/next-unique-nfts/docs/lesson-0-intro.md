# Building an NFT Application on Asset Hub

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on building an NFT application on Polkadot's Asset Hub using Next.js and the Unique SDK. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working application where users can:

- ‚úÖ Connect a Polkadot wallet using the Polkadot.js extension.
- ‚úÖ Create NFT collections on Asset Hub.
- ‚úÖ Mint NFTs with metadata.
- ‚úÖ Fetch and display NFTs owned by a wallet.
- ‚úÖ Use metadata standards to store NFT attributes on IPFS.

This tutorial is designed for developers who want to dive into NFT development on Polkadot's Asset Hub.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses `next.js` as one of the most widely used frontend frameworks. However, using the provided examples in any different framework should not be a challenge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial focuses on creating collections and NFTs on Asset Hub. While it touches on related tools like IPFS and indexers, it does not cover them in depth. However, helpful links and resources will be provided for those who want to explore these topics further.

## Install and Set Up the Polkadot.js Wallet

Since this application interacts with Polkadot's Asset Hub, you need the Polkadot wallet to sign transactions and manage accounts.

1. Install the `Polkadot.js` Extension: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/
2. Open the extension and create a new wallet or import an existing one using a seed phrase.

## Let's Start Building!

With everything set up, you're ready to start coding! In the next lesson, we'll set up our Next.js project and configure the environment for NFT development. üöÄ
